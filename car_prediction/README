Clustering models:

K Means Clustering
Used ELBOW Method to identify the number of clusters
Used Customers Age, Applicant Annual Income, Credit Score as features to create the cluster and plot them in 2D and 3D plots
With new customer data, we get the cluster to which customer belongs using kmeans.predict
Once the cluster is known, the TOP THREE CARS in the given cluster is recommended to the Customer as part of RECOMMENDER SYSTEM
Hierarchical Clustering
Tried  Hierarchical clustering to identify the number of clusters using the same set of features
Implemented the basic clustering for comparison
